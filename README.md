## Getting Started

To get started with this sample application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/sample-meteor-app.git
   cd sample-meteor-app
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```sh
   meteor npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```sh
   meteor run
   ```

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Allows users to log in using the `abroa01:mieapi-meteor` package.
- **API Interaction:** Provides interfaces to interact with APIs using `GET` and `PUT` requests.
- **Responsive UI:** Simple and responsive UI built with React.

## Installation

Ensure you have [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install) installed on your machine.

To use the `abroa01:mieapi-meteor` package, you need to install it via Atmosphere:

```sh
meteor add abroa01:mieapi-meteor
```

## Usage

### Login Component

The `Login` component handles user authentication. It takes a `userHandle` prop, which is passed to the `MieApi.initializeSession` method along with the entered username and password.

**Example Usage:**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { MieApi } from 'meteor/abroa01:mieapi-meteor';

const Login = ({ onLogin, userHandle }) => {
  // Component code...
};
```

### API Component

The `ApiComponent` allows users to interact with APIs. It supports `GET` and `PUT` requests, sending the necessary authentication cookies and user handle.

**Example Usage:**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { MieApi } from 'meteor/abroa01:mieapi-meteor';

const ApiComponent = ({ cookie, userHandle, onLogout }) => {
  // Component code...
};
```
